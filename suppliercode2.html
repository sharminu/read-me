Forced and Indentured Labor
In accordance with applicable law, no Supplier should perform work or produce goods for Yum using labor under any form of indentured servitude, nor should threats of violence, physical punishment, confinement or other form of physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse be used as a method of discipline or control.
